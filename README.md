# MComp-Research-Project-2022-23
This repository contains the code for my MComp Research Project at the University of Lincoln for the academic year 2022/23

#The Project: British Sign Language Fingerspelling Translator
The aim of this project is to create a machine learning classification model that can in real time, classify differing letters of BSL. 
The secondary aim of this project would be to develop a working system with a UI which shows the translation and the video input side-by side.
